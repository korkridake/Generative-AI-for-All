# Generative AI for All

Artificial intelligence has been affecting and transforming our lives for decades. But over the past few years, AI has made incredible progress, with some applications becoming so advanced that they are quickly becoming a powerful force in various industries, with the potential to reshape entire economies—and even reshape society.

This technology is called generative AI. It will reinvent how we humans will create content. It will redefine how we work, from automating mundane tasks to writing complex code. And it will accelerate our innovation to new levels. Whether you’re a senior executive or any aspiring leader, learning how this technology works, why it can be disruptive for your business and industry, as well as its limitations, is critical for your company and your career. Join me as I show you key tools and insights to help you use generative AI to reinvent the future of your business.

## Glossary

- Algorithm: A sequence of computational instructions that enables a computer to perform a task such as object recognition or predictive analytics
- Artificial Intelligence (AI): A field of computer science that studies how to create machines that can replicate cognitive tasks such as problem-solving, reasoning, perception, and language understanding
- Artificial General Intelligence (AGI): Artificial intelligence that is capable of solving a wide range of
problems, much as humans can, rather than excelling at one specific task
- ChatGPT: A conversational AI model based on GPT, which can be used to create chatbots or interact with users in natural language
- Classification: The categorization of various forms of AI based on features such as the type of data 
they process, the tasks they can perform, and the specific techniques or algorithms they employ
- Computing Power: The amount of processing power available to a computer system, which can 
impact the speed and accuracy of AI algorithms
- Deep Learning: A type of machine learning that uses multilayered neural networks to extract high-level patterns from data
- Diffusion Model: A model that is used to learn the latent structure of a data set by modeling the way data points diffuse through a latent space. This technique can be applied to various tasks such as image generation, denoising, and super-resolution.
- Fine-Tuning: The process of making small changes to an AI algorithm to improve its performance
- GPT: The Generative Pretrained Transformer model, which is a deep learning language model 
used for natural language processing (NLP) tasks
- Large Language Models (LLM): A subset of AI that allows machines to understand and process 
large quantities of text
- Machine Learning: A subset of AI that enables computers to discover patterns in data in order to 
make predictions or decisions on their own
- Responsible AI: Ensuring that AI applications are designed in a way that minimizes bias, preserves 
privacy, and meets regulatory requirements
- Synthetic Data: Artificially generated data that can be substituted for real-time data to train 
AI algorithms
- Transformers: A type of neural network that uses self-attention mechanisms to process large 
sequences of data
- Training Data: A set of data that is used to help “train” an AI algorithm so that it can learn to 
improve its performance
- Workflow Automation: The use of software technologies to automate recurring tasks within a 
business process
