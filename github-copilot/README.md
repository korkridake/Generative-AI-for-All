GitHub Copilot is a tool that helps you write code faster and with less effort. It is powered by a system that learns from billions of lines of public code and natural language comments. GitHub Copilot can suggest whole lines or entire functions for you, based on the context of your code and the problem you are trying to solve. You can use GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code, either as an extension or as part of GitHub Codespaces
